/*This code is undoubtedly missing some crucial elements,
 such as the use of OOP and its importance. Unfortunately, 
time constraints didn't allow us to implement these aspects. 
Instead, we focused on adding more features to the game 
and being creative with its components to ensure 
an enjoyable user experience. 
Our primary aim was to maximize what we could achieve within the game itself.

Rest assured, we will definitely complete this code, 
organize it, and refactor it into several well-structured classes using OOP principles.
Until then, we hope you enjoy the game and understand our situation. 
We are committed to improving the game's quality and performance, and especially the code quality, in the near future.
